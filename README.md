# Brown and Riding VIN Automation Project

This project automates the classification of vehicles using their Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) for insurance purposes. By leveraging advanced programming techniques and automation tools, the manual, time-consuming process is replaced with an efficient, automated system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the VIN automation system on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Download `Brown-Riding-VIN-Automation.zip` and extract it to your desired folder.
2. Set the working directory to the extracted folder, specifically `ExtractedFolder\Data`.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed to run the automation script:

1. Python 3.8 or above
2. The latest version of Google Chrome
3. Selenium WebDriver for Chrome

You will need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install selenium openpyxl
